Button with Hover Effect

This project showcases a simple button that changes color when hovered over. It's an easy-to-implement example of enhancing user interface (UI) interactivity using CSS.

Features

A single button styled with CSS.

On hover, the button's color changes to provide visual feedback to users.

Demo

You can view the working example of the button in action by opening the provided HTML file in a web browser.

Files Included

index.html: Contains the structure of the button.

style.css: Defines the styling and hover effects for the button.

How It Works

HTML: The button is defined with a basic <button> element, optionally with a class for styling.

CSS: The :hover pseudo-class is used to define the hover effect, which changes the button's color when the mouse pointer is over it.
